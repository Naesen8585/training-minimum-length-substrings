Minimum Length Substrings

You are given two strings s and t. You can select any substring of string s and rearrange the characters of the selected substring. Determine the minimum length of the substring of s such that string t is a substring of the selected substring.

Signature

int minLengthSubstring(String s, String t)

Input

s and t are non-empty strings that contain less than 1,000,000 characters each

Output

Return the minimum length of the substring of s. If it is not possible, return -1

Example

s = "dcbefebce"

t = "fd"'

output = 5

Explanation:

Substring "dcbef" can be rearranged to "cfdeb", "cefdb", and so on. String t is a substring of "cfdeb". Thus, the minimum length required is 5.

**MY IDE IS THROWING ERRORS WHEN FIRST LOADING THIS CODE**

That's right. It's incomplete. Its your job to fill in the blanks.

**WHY DOES THIS README LOOK TERRIBLE**
fine. do a fork/ readme fix up / PR to here and I'll accept it.
